# Python-BusinessIntelligence-Scraper

## Description
Python-BusinessIntelligence-Scraper is designed to demonstrate how to integrate Python's scripting capabilities with business intelligence tools for effective data scraping and analysis. This project, serving as an example, focuses on extracting data from financial websites like JustETF.com and processing it through pandas in Jupyter notebooks to be visualized in Power BI. It aims to show analysts and investors how to derive visual insights into investment portfolios, enhancing decision-making processes.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Automated scraping of ETF information from JustETF.com.
- **Data Processing**: Utilization of pandas in Jupyter for efficient data handling and transformations.
- **Visualization**: Dynamic visualizations in Power BI to represent the scraped data effectively.
- **Educational Purpose**: Serves as a practical example for educational purposes on integrating Python with BI tools.

## Example Visualizations
Below are some example visualizations created in Power BI from the data scraped and processed by this tool:
